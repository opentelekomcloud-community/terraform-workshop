## Slide 2

Over the past sessions, we’ve walked through the core concepts of Infrastructure as Code,
explored Terraform’s building blocks, practiced using the OpenTelekomCloud provider,
and looked at advanced patterns like automation with Ansible, multitenancy, and GitOps workflows.

You’ve seen how to start from a minimal deployment, grow it into reusable modules, and manage multiple tenants or environments with safe, remote-stored state.

The goal isn’t just to learn commands — it’s to design infrastructure that is consistent, secure, and easy to evolve.

Whether you apply these patterns with Terraform, integrate them into CI/CD pipelines, or extend them with other IaC tools, the principles remain the same: version your infrastructure, review every change, and automate wherever you can.
